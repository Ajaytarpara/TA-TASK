It may be possibale you get error while run this code then you can solve by doing this
- you might forgot to start mongo service
- you might forgot to make .env file from .env.example
- you might forgot to run code npm i
- you might using lower version of node
- you might run code from differnt path if you are inside TA-TASK then you can use npm start if you are inside of src then run node index.js
